This project involved making a responsive version of the current CCI Give theme. I built it from the ground up (using Reverie, my favorite framework parent theme for WordPress), and got it to look almost identical; except, unlike its predecessor, itâ€™s responsive (with a phablet view for good measure!). The theme was live and functional (in some state or other) since its development until it was recently replaced.

Phablet view:
