This project was one I was a part of for well over a year; it began in 2014 when I met the cofounders at a hackathon here in Chicago. They explained what they were looking for, and I was eager to start learning AngularJS and working with them. I completed a basic prototype at the hackathon, and our business partnership grew from there.

I helped guide the team towards mobile-first design, and led several meetings where the team solidified exactly what they wanted built. I then worked with a backend developer to help get the backend ready for work; with that out of the way, construction began on the frontend. I was unfortunately forced to step away from the project for a bit; at that point, another developer was brought on board, and I began to meet with her weekly to mentor her and the team she led, as they had no prior experience with Angular.

Once that team was finished working on the project, I was brought back in to finish a prototype. Currently, the team is very close to having an MVP, though is not there yet. I have been forced once again to step away from the project.

However, you can check out the progress we made on the repo [here](https://github.com/andymcguinness/Planet-Lab).
