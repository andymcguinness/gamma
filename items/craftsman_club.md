This project was one of the most intensive projects I've ever worked on. A smaller team was brought together from the agency I worked at, and we implemented the Agile methodology, having daily standups each morning, and tracking our sprints and user stories with Pivotal Tracker.

I was a part of the conversations from before development began; I helped guide some of the UI/UX decisions, and used my eye for detail to ensure consistency across the designs. I then got to work coding the front-end of the app, building out a styleguide first (using SCSS), and then implementing the styleguide in the most extensible way possible.

Towards the end of the project, another developer was brought in, and together, we worked as quickly as possible to make the site responsive. The site finally launched, responsive and all, and the client was thrilled.

The project used the git-flow workflow, and was hosted on/deployed to Heroku.
