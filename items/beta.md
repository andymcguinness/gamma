This redesign of my personal website was the first one to go live in nearly a year. It was a much-needed update for my tired old site!

This project stemmed from a class project; I had been meaning to redesign the site from scratch, and with a school project requiring everything I wanted on my site, I felt it was time.

If you want an in-depth explanation of how the site was built, check out my [blog post](http://beta.andymcguinness.com/redesigning-my-site-responsive-style/) on the topic.

You can see the site live (still) on [beta.andymcguinness.com](http://beta.andymcguinness.com).
